✅ LeetCode Solutions in Java — Clean, Organized, and FAANG-Ready
📌 Overview

This repository contains my clean, optimized, and well-structured LeetCode solutions written in Java, organized by algorithmic topic.
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate strong computer science fundamentals, consistent problem-solving skills, and readiness for technical interviews at top tech companies (FAANG).

🎯 Purpose of This Repository

To showcase mastery of data structures and algorithms in Java

To present a clean, maintainable coding style

To demonstrate consistency and continuous improvement

To prepare for FAANG-level software engineering interviews

Each Java solution includes:

Problem Name

Difficulty

LeetCode Link

Brief Approach Summary

Clean + optimized Java implementation

This structure reflects how FAANG categorizes coding interview problems.

🧠 Java Coding Philosophy

My Java solutions follow these principles:

✔ Clarity and Readability

Consistent Java formatting, meaningful variable names, and readable logic.

✔ Optimized Complexity

Solutions target efficient time and space usage, using appropriate data structures (HashMap, ArrayList, Stack, PriorityQueue, etc.).

✔ Well-Documented Code

Each file begins with a short explanation of:

Problem goal

Main idea/approach

Reasoning behind the Java data structures used

✔ Industry-Level Practices

Using:

Java Collections Framework

O(n), O(log n), or optimal patterns whenever possible

Clean class and method structure

🚀 Interview Topics Covered (Java-Focused)

This repository demonstrates strong skills in:

Arrays & Strings

HashMaps / HashSets

Linked Lists

Trees & Binary Trees

Graphs & BFS/DFS

Recursion

Backtracking

Dynamic Programming

Two-Pointer Techniques

Binary Search Patterns

Heaps / Priority Queues

Greedy Strategies

These are the exact categories tested in FAANG technical interviews.

📈 Progress & Updates

I am actively updating this repository with new Java solutions as I continue practicing and improving.

This shows:

Continuous learning

Long-term commitment

Serious preparation for top-tier engineering roles
